      <ul class="summary-data">
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Cost (manual)</span>
          The cost of running the tool manually in a web browser. Paid tools will usually let you check single pages for free, but will redirect you to a login page for some features like documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Cost (CI)</span>
          The cost of running the tool if you code it into your service under continuous integration (CI). Some tools are free to run but you have to pay for features like API access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Open Source</span>
          The tool is open source, which means you can access the source code for free. You may also be able to help to make the tool better if you can fix a problem with the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Active</span>
          The tool is being actively developed. We recommend using tools that are updated according to the latest developments in accessibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">CI</span>
          The tool can be run under continuous integration (CI). Projects using a CI environment should use an automated testing tool that works with CI. This will help you make sure mistakes in your build are caught early.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">CLI</span>
          The tool can be run on a command line interface (CLI). CLI tools are more versatile for developers, and can usually be integrated into either continuous integration (CI) or unit testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">In-browser</span>
          The tool works in a web browser. These tools are usually extensions and are easy to install and use, making them useful for non-developers. In-browser tools often make it easier to test things like individual scenarios and internal tools behind firewalls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Internal use</span>
          The tool can be used internally. This might be useful if your service is for internal use only or has sensitive components that you don’t want to test on the internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Mobile</span>
          The tool can simulate a mobile browser and test with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="result-type">Scriptable</span>
          You can write a script for the tool to follow whilst testing. Some tools can accept scripted user behaviour (to simulate things like filling in a text box or clicking a button) and use them for testing.
        </li>
