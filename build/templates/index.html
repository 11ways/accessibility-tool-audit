      <h1>How do automated accessibility checkers compare?</h1>

      <p>
        We ran an audit to see what issues the different accessibility testing tools pick up. We deliberately introduced 143 accessibility barriers to a page of content, and ran them through 10 accessibility checkers.
      </p>

      <p>We also had a look at features like usability and cost.</p>

      <p>You can use our audit to help choose the best accessibility testing tool for your service.</p>
